This Project uses XG Boost Algorithm for Credit Card Fraud Detection.
Hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost is done using GridSearch CV and
Randomized Search CV.
The dataset used is from Kaggle and several visualizations have been
performed on the dataset for better feature extraction and finding the 
correlations between different features.
